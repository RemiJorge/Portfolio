        <h2 className={styles.heading}>üëã Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm a dedicated and curious engineer with a deep passion for{" "}
          Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. Recently graduated
          from Polytech Montpellier, I specialize in designing and deploying
          AI-powered systems that are both technically robust and operationally
          relevant. Whether it‚Äôs building LLM-based diagnostic assistants or
          implementing real-time anomaly detection systems for mission-critical
          environments, I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant,
          data-driven solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background blends a rigorous academic foundation with hands-on
          experience across a range of technologies‚Äîfrom machine learning
          frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, to full-stack web and mobile
          development using Python, React, and Node.js. I take pride in
          delivering high-quality, scalable software, and I‚Äôm driven by a core
          belief: that responsible AI can profoundly improve the way we live,
          work, and solve real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the code, I value clarity in design, security in architecture,
          and collaboration in execution. I thrive in fast-paced environments
          where technical excellence, creativity, and strong communication
          intersect to create meaningful impact.

          üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Beyond Tech: My Passion for Athletics
        </h2>
        <p>
          For over a decade, I dedicated myself to competitive athletics,
          training and competing at club level in events ranging from the{" "}
          100m and 200m to my specialty‚Äîthe{" "}
          400m sprint. I had the privilege of competing
          multiple times at the <strong>French national championships</strong>,
          frequently ranking in the top 4 in relay events such
          as the 4x200m.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this journey, I‚Äôve developed core values that shape how I work
          today: <strong>discipline</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>resilience under pressure</strong>, and a relentless drive to{" "}
          <strong>push my limits</strong>. Training for high-stakes events has
          taught me how to structure long-term goals, embrace setbacks as
          learning opportunities, and thrive in a team-oriented,
          high-performance environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, while I no longer compete at the same level, I continue to
          challenge myself through running and hiking. Whether it‚Äôs on the track
          or in life, my mindset remains the same: always strive to grow,
          improve, and give your best.
